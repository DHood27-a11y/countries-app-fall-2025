:brain: VERSION 2 PSEUDO-CODE WORKSHEET
-------------------------------------
This is our WHAT, WHEN, WHERE, HOW framework for working with data:
1. WHAT data should we store & retrieve?
   List the key/value pair, data type, example value.
2. WHEN should we store & retrieve the data?
   What event or user action is the trigger, such as clicking a button, submitting a form, or loading a page?
3. WHERE does this happen in the code?
   What component, page or function?
4. HOW do we accomplish this?
   What steps do we need to take?
   Do we need to...
    - render anything in JSX?
    - make any functions? If so, when would we call those functions?
    - use any useState or useEffect hooks?
    - set or get an item from localStorage?
  Remember: This is pseudo-code. Don't write code yet â€” just outline the actions in plain language.
:sparkles: YOUR TASK: Fill in the answers to each WHAT/WHEN/WHERE/HOW question below for the 3 pieces of data.
------------------------
:bar_chart: FORM DATA
------------------------
WHAT data should we store & retrieve?
KEY: "__user-profile_____"
VALUE: _the data from the form that the user submits______
VALUE DATA TYPE: _object______
EXAMPLE VALUE: _{
    name:""
    email:""
    country:""
    bio: ""_
}_____
------------------------
:large_orange_diamond: STORING FORM DATA
------------------------
WHEN: _when the user clicks submit______
WHERE: _Saved countries page______
HOW:
Step 1: Create handleSubmit that gets values from form and saves in localStorage_______
Step 2: _Add the handleSubmit as an onSubmit prop and make sure its being called when the user clicks the submit button ______
Step 3: _you then want to save the form data to local storage using setItem method and stringify method______
Add more steps as needed!
------------------------
:large_orange_diamond: RETRIEVING FORM DATA
------------------------
WHEN: _When the user loads the saved countries page______
WHERE: _Saved countries page above the form______
HOW:
Step 1: _we need to make useEffect that gets the form data when the page first loads and saves it into our dependency array______
Step 2: _we have to use .parse to turn the string data type back to its original data type _____
Step 3: _we need to call our setter function and pass in user-profile______
Add more steps as needed!
------------------------
:bar_chart: SAVED COUNTRIES DATA
------------------------
WHAT data should we store & retrieve?
KEY: "_savedCountries______"
VALUE: _saved countries_____
VALUE DATA TYPE: _an array of strings__
EXAMPLE VALUE: _
   [Afghanistan, India, China]___
------------------------
:large_orange_diamond: STORING SAVED COUNTRIES DATA
------------------------
WHEN: _when the user clicks the save button___
WHERE: __on the countryDetail page____
HOW:
Step 1: _need to attach and onClick handler to save button________
Step 2: when the user clicks save button, will call the handleClick function
Step 3: _Handleclick function needs to save the country's name in localStorage____
Step 4: Thhe handleClick function will first get the array of saved countries from local storage. If the country is already saved, then there is no need to save the country. If the country is not saved yet, then _add the country's name to the array of savedCountries and store that value in localStorage___________________
Add more steps as needed!
------------------------
:large_orange_diamond: RETRIEVING SAVED COUNTRIES DATA
------------------------
WHEN: when the saved countries page loads_______
WHERE: _On the saved countries page in the saved countries section___
HOW:
Step 1: Call localStorage.getItem("savedCountries")_______
Step 2: If it exists use .parse method to turn it back into an array_using .parse method______
Step 3: _Updated the savedCountries state using setter function______
Step 4: _need to map through countries and then render to screen using countryCard component _________________________
Add more steps as needed!
------------------------
:bar_chart: COUNTRY COUNTS DATA
------------------------
WHAT data should we store & retrieve?
KEY: "__country's name_____"
VALUE: _view count______
VALUE DATA TYPE: number_______
EXAMPLE VALUE: _5______
------------------------
:large_orange_diamond: STORING & RETRIEVING COUNTRY COUNTS DATA
------------------------
NOTE: We combine storing & retrieving country counts data into one section because they always happen together. Each time we look up a countryâ€™s view count, we also need to increase it and save the new total.
WHEN: _when the user visits _____
WHERE: __Country details page_____
HOW:
Step 1: __useState for view count_____
Step 2: useEffect to retrieve, add one, and_store the new number in local storage______
Step 3: __Update the value of viewCount using setViewCount_____
Step 4: Show the viewCount variable to the user by rendering it in the JSX
